## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `BAPTAB` (Table 7.16): off-by-one at positions 26 and 30 that was
  shifting every bap in the 23..=34 range by one, mis-quantizing
  mid-band mantissas. PSNR vs ffmpeg on the 440 Hz sine fixture
  jumps from 35.7 dB to 92.0 dB as a direct result.
- `MASKTAB` (Table 7.13): off-by-one at rows A=8, 9, 10, 15 that was
  mapping four high-frequency mantissa bins into the wrong 1/6 octave
  band, skewing bit-allocation masking on wide-bandwidth content.
- `LATAB` (Table 7.14) entry 151: `0x0002` → `0x0003` to match spec
  Table 7.14, row A=15 column B=1.

### Added

- `tests/fixtures/transient_bursts_stereo.ac3`: three Gaussian tone
  bursts, 62 short-block audblks across 63 frames, exercising the
  `blksw=1` IMDCT path that the sine fixture never touches.
- `decoder_matches_ffmpeg_on_transient_fixture` PSNR gate for the
  short-block / block-switching regression.
- `decoder_matches_ffmpeg_within_psnr_floor` gate ratcheted from
  25 dB to 80 dB now that the BAPTAB fix lands.
- `examples/count_blksw`, `examples/psnr_per_frame` diagnostic
  tools for inspecting short-block coverage and per-frame decode
  quality.

### Changed

- `audblk::imdct_256_pair` direct-form short-block IMDCT is now
  `#[cfg(test)]`-only. The §7.9.4.2 FFT decomposition
  (`imdct::imdct_256_pair_fft`) is canonical; the naive per-half
  reference disagrees with it (see the
  `short_block_direct_form_diverges_from_fft` regression test).
